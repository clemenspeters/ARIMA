# Anomaly detection on ARIMA manifolds

This repository is a code playground for my master thesis at TU Berlin.
This means there is a lot of experimental code and copy/paste parts,
rather than a production ready perfect project right now.


## Autoencoder

Run:

```
python3 autoencoderExample.py
```  

or to record logs:

```
python3 autoencoderExample.py | tee autoencoder/log.txt
```
